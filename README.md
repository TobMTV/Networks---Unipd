On that repository i will list my preparation exercise for networks exam (some of them need a look to work).
You will find these topics:

- **ARP**
- **Base64 encoding/decoding**
- **How to use checksum**
- **IP fragmentation method**
- **Server and client communication**
- **Chucked packets**
- **Unrechable networks**
- **TCP/UDP**
- **Windows size**
- **Authentication**

Vi editor is really advised for C networks code.
